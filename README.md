# ðŸª¨ ML Use Case 1: Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project applies machine learning to classify sonar signals as reflections from either **rocks** or **underwater mines**. It demonstrates the use of supervised learning models on frequency-based data for defense or sonar-based underwater navigation systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

**Source**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Sonar Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))

- **Features**: 60 numerical attributes representing sonar signal energy in various frequency bands  
- **Target**:  
  - `R` = Rock  
  - `M` = Mine

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

To build a binary classification model that accurately predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a **rock** or a **mine** based on its signal profile.

## ðŸ“Š Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Checked data structure and statistics  
   - Analyzed class distribution  

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Encoded labels (`R` â†’ 0, `M` â†’ 1)  
   - Scaled features using `StandardScaler`  
   - Split data into training and test sets  

3. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - (Optional) k-NN or XGBoost  

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - ROC Curve (optional)
